Excellent — turning on “Open to Work” is a good first step. Now you want to multiply your visibility and control the flow instead of waiting for recruiters to stumble across your profile. Let’s talk practical strategy — from low-effort boosts to deep-reach moves.

**1. Recruiter and job-board ecosystem**
LinkedIn is just one tentacle. You should also build visibility on:

* **Indeed Resume & ZipRecruiter Profile:** they’re still the first stop for corporate HR systems. Upload your resume and keep titles keyword-rich.
* **Well-curated niche boards:** try **Stack Overflow Jobs (devs)**, **Dice** (tech), **AngelList / Wellfound** (startups), **RemoteOK** and **WeWorkRemotely** (remote-only).
* **Hired.com or Turing:** they reverse the process — companies apply to *you*.

**2. Direct outreach strategy**
Most good hires come from human networks, not algorithms.

* Identify 20-30 companies whose *work* genuinely interests you (not just who’s hiring). Follow their employees on LinkedIn, comment intelligently on posts, then message recruiters or team leads directly.
* Use Hunter.io or RocketReach to find recruiter or hiring manager emails; send short, targeted notes (two paragraphs tops).
* Keep a small Notion or Sheet tracker — company, role, contact, follow-up date, notes. (You probably already have this.)

**3. GitHub and portfolio polish**
Given your background (Oracle → automation → Python/DevOps pivot), a strong GitHub portfolio is your most powerful hook.

* Make a **README landing page** that summarizes your key projects and links to live demos.
* Add **“featured repos”** that mirror your job goals (automation, DevOps tooling, or data integration).
* Keep commit history active weekly — recruiters equate recent commits with engagement.

**4. Recruiter magnetization**
Recruiters search by keywords. On LinkedIn, fill your **headline** and **About** with tech-relevant terms (Ansible, Postgres, CI/CD, Supabase, Next.js — all fair game). Use the “Add Skills” section aggressively — you get 50 slots; fill them all.

**5. Direct company applications**
Don’t ignore company career portals. Set up saved searches on:

* Google Jobs (meta-aggregator, surprisingly useful)
* Workday and Greenhouse (used by many large firms)
* Lever (common in tech/startups)

**6. Professional communities and referrals**

* Discord or Slack communities like **r/ExperiencedDevs**, **DevOps Lounge**, **PostgreSQL Slack**, or **Tech Career Growth** often post internal openings before they’re public.
* Alumni networks — even old coworkers from CA or Charter — can be gold. Message them; “Hey, I’m exploring new roles — any openings on your team?” works better than you’d think.

**7. Freelance or contract work**
If you need short-term income or want to keep sharpening skills:

* **Upwork** and **Toptal** are decent for automation and scripting gigs.
* **Braintrust** and **Contra** lean toward higher-end freelance work.

**8. Visibility-boost hacks**

* Post once a week on LinkedIn with insights, project snippets, or reflections. Recruiters notice consistency.
* Set your LinkedIn location to major tech hubs (Charlotte, Raleigh, Remote — U.S.) to broaden recruiter filters.
* Join and engage in LinkedIn groups related to DevOps, Automation, or Postgres.

If you want, I can build you a **step-by-step weekly plan** that combines all this into repeatable actions (networking cadence, portfolio maintenance, recruiter outreach, job board sweeps).
Would you like me to lay that out?
