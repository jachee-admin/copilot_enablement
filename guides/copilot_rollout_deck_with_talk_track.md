**John [Last Name] – AI Enablement & Automation Engineer**
> Structured onboarding and measurable outcomes for AI-assisted development.

| **Slide Content** | **Talk-Track Notes (for Presenter View)** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ## 1. The Challenge<br>Developers were losing momentum on boilerplate code and documentation, while leadership was cautious about ungoverned AI tools.<br><br>**Pain Points → Goals**<br>• Inconsistent prompt quality → Define structured playbook<br>• Security concerns → Create guardrails and approvals<br>• No clear ROI → Measure time savings + sentiment | *Open by naming the tension between innovation and control.*<br>“Most teams rush to install Copilot; we treated it as a governance challenge, not a toy. Our aim was velocity with safety.” |
| ## 2. Pilot Overview<br>**Group:** 10 engineers across automation, DevOps, and data<br>**Duration:** 4 weeks<br>**Languages:** Python, Ansible, Bash<br>**Outputs:** ETL scripts, Jenkins jobs, automation roles | “We deliberately used live work. Real Jira tickets, not demos. That gave us production-grade feedback within four weeks.” |
| ## 3. Framework for Safe Acceleration<br>**Four pillars:**<br>1️⃣ Prompt Playbook<br>2️⃣ Review Checklist<br>3️⃣ Metrics Tracker<br>4️⃣ Guardrails (security + policy)<br><br>_Feedback loop diagram:_ Prompt → Review → Measure → Improve → Scale | “The secret was feedback loops. Each pillar reinforced the others—Copilot became part of the SDLC, not an outsider.” |
| ## 4. Prompt Playbook Example<br>**Naïve:** ‘Write a Python script to parse logs.’<br>**Structured:** ‘Write portable `parse_logs.py` that counts ERROR lines, outputs JSON summary, includes comments.’ | “This slide always lands well. Developers instantly get why the second prompt yields 3× better output—clarity begets quality.” |
| ## 5. Governance & Security<br>✅ No proprietary data in prompts<br>✅ All AI-assisted commits reviewed<br>✅ SonarQube + pre-commit scans<br>✅ Tagged Copilot suggestions | “We built light guardrails, not bureaucracy. It reassured InfoSec and freed engineers to explore responsibly.” |
| ## 6. Quantitative Results<br>| Metric | Baseline | Copilot | Δ |<br>|---|---|---|---|<br>| Script time | 60m | 25m | –58% |<br>| PR turnaround | 2.3d | 1.5d | –35% |<br>| Satisfaction | — | 8.7/10 | ↑ | | “These numbers show we hit the trifecta—faster, cleaner, happier. We reported deltas, not vanity metrics.” |
| ## 7. Qualitative Insights<br>🗣 “Feels like pair-programming with docs built in.”<br>🗣 “I stopped tabbing to StackOverflow 50× a day.”<br>🗣 “Learning patterns faster than ever.” | “Leadership loved this slide. Nothing sells ROI like authentic voices from the floor.” |
| ## 8. Lessons Learned<br>• Train before rollout – skill before scale.<br>• Treat prompts as code – version + review.<br>• Govern lightly – empower, don’t police.<br>• Automate ROI tracking – proof beats anecdotes. | “If you remember one thing, remember this: enablement isn’t a tool install, it’s a culture shift.” |
| ## 9. Scaling to Enterprise<br>**Next Steps:**<br>1️⃣ 25-user pilot → 2️⃣ org-wide enablement<br>3️⃣ Extend guardrails to M365 Copilot<br>4️⃣ Integrate ROI into DevOps analytics | “This is where Duke or any large org can start: pilot, prove, propagate.” |
| ## 10. The Payoff<br>> Structured onboarding + measurable outcomes = sustainable adoption.<br><br>🎯 *Copilot isn’t just an assistant—it’s a multiplier when rolled out responsibly.* | “End with conviction: responsible AI doesn’t slow teams down; it lets them accelerate safely.” |
